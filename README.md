The project aims to deliver a predictive model that can accurately estimate medical costs for
patients based on their demographic, lifestyle, health status, and other relevant factors.
Additionally, the project will provide actionable insights for Hospital ABC to improve resource
allocation, healthcare planning, and patient support services, ultimately enhancing the quality and
accessibility of healthcare services for its patients.
